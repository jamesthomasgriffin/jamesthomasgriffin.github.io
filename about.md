I am a mathematician and my academic research is in algebraic topology, with a particular focus on the algebra of configuration spaces.  But this is a place to put thoughts which aren't entirely academic, perhaps ideas that I don't have the time or resources to chase up, but which I think are worth sharing.  There isn't enough time to write down all my thoughts on these topics, so get in touch if you'd like me to expand on any of these ideas.
